<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laser Vision Correction Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Excimer Laser</li><li>Femtosecond Laser</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The laser vision correction market primarily features two technologies: Excimer lasers and Femtosecond lasers. Excimer lasers utilize ultraviolet light to reshape the cornea by removing precise amounts of tissue, effectively correcting refractive errors like myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. In contrast, Femtosecond lasers employ a rapid series of light pulses to create a corneal flap, allowing for a more accurate and minimally invasive procedure. Both types enhance visual acuity, driving significant demand in the global ophthalmic surgery market.</p></p>
