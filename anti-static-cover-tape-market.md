<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Static Cover Tape Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heat Activated Cover Tapes</li><li>Pressure-Sensitive Cover Tapes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-static cover tape market primarily comprises two types: heat-activated cover tapes and pressure-sensitive cover tapes. Heat-activated cover tapes bond when exposed to heat, creating a strong seal while dissipating static electricity, making them ideal for sensitive electronic components. In contrast, pressure-sensitive cover tapes adhere upon application of pressure, providing a convenient and instant bond without the need for heat, suitable for various packaging and surface protection applications where static control is essential. Both types serve critical roles in electronics and manufacturing industries.</p></p>
