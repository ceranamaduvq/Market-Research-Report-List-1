<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiation Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External</li><li>Internal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiation therapy is primarily categorized into two types: external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and internal radiation therapy (brachytherapy). </p><p>EBRT involves directing high-energy beams from outside the body towards the tumor, targeting cancer cells while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. This method is commonly used for various cancers. </p><p>In contrast, internal radiation therapy involves placing radioactive sources directly inside or near the tumor. This allows for a higher dose of radiation to be delivered precisely where it's needed, enhancing treatment effectiveness.</p></p>
